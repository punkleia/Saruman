# Saruman

I want a gradient of specific colors to draw on

I want the pixels to breathe. I like the sin wave function used on the staff for this

I want each pixel to change color slowly as it is breathing

I do not want it to look like an animated rainbow effect - I want the pixels somewhat out of sync

Maybe have each pixel determine it's next color to be between three and six increments forward or back from where it currently is

Look at how different saturations change the diffusion of light

How low does brightness have to be for it not to look like Christmas lights?
