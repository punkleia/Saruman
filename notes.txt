# Saruman

I want a gradient of specific colors to draw on
I want the pixels to breathe
I want each pixel to change color slowly as it is breathing
I do not want it to look like an animated rainbow effect - I want the pixels somewhat out of sync
Maybe have each pixel determine it's next color to be between three and six increments forward or back from where it currently is
Look at how different saturations change the effect of light
How low does brightness have to be for it not to look like Christmas lights?
